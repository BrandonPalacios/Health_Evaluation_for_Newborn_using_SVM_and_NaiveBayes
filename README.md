# Health_Evaluation_for_Newborn_using_SVM_and_NaiveBayes
## Health Evaluation of newborn babies usin Support Vector Machine and Naive Bayes Algorithms. (Spanish Version)

I use the Naive Bayes and SVM (*with the Grid Search function*) to predict the health of a newborn during labor. I calculated the ROC Curve and AUC for each algorithm and compared to select the optimal model. Using the Grid Search function I updated the hyperparameters for the SVM and found the best values to get the most AUC for it.

Also, I calculated the accuracy of the model getting almost 90%.
